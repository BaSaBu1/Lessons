## Reading Text

**Title**: *Daily Life in the International Space Station*

The International Space Station, or ISS, **is** a large science laboratory that orbits Earth. It **is** about 400 kilometers above the ground and travels at 28,000 kilometers per hour. The station **is** a joint project between several countries, including the United States, Russia, Japan, and members of the European Space Agency.

There **are** usually six astronauts living and working on the ISS. They **are** from different countries, and they all speak English on the station. The ISS **is** not very big, but it has everything they need: computers, tools, food, and even exercise machines.

A normal day on the ISS **starts** at 6:00 a.m. The astronauts **wake up**, **brush their teeth**, and **check** the station’s systems. After that, they **eat breakfast** and **begin** their work. Some astronauts **run** experiments to learn how space affects the human body. Others **are taking** photographs of the Earth or **are fixing** equipment.

Exercise **is** an important part of daily life in space. Astronauts **exercise** for two hours each day to keep their muscles strong. Right now, one astronaut **is using** a treadmill while another **is cycling** on a special space bike. Without gravity, muscles and bones can become weak very quickly.

In the afternoon, astronauts **attend** meetings, **write reports**, and **talk** to scientists on Earth. Sometimes they **speak** with students or journalists using video calls. These activities help people on Earth understand more about life in space.

At the end of the day, the astronauts **relax** by watching movies, reading books, or writing emails to their families. Their sleeping bags **are** attached to the walls so they don’t float away while sleeping.

Life on the ISS **is** very different from life on Earth, but the astronauts **are working** hard every day. They **are helping** us learn how humans can live in space for long periods. Their work **is** important for the future of science and space exploration.
