**Title**: *The History and Impact of Vaccination*

Vaccination **has become** one of the most important medical achievements in human history. It **has saved** millions of lives by preventing deadly diseases. But how did it start?

The first vaccine **was developed** in 1796 by Edward Jenner, an English doctor. He **noticed** that milkmaids who **had caught** cowpox never **got** smallpox. Jenner **took** material from a cowpox sore and **injected** it into a young boy. The boy **did not develop** smallpox. This experiment **marked** the beginning of vaccination.

Since then, scientists **have created** vaccines for many dangerous diseases, such as polio, measles, and influenza. The World Health Organization (WHO) **has reported** that smallpox **has been eliminated** completely due to worldwide vaccination campaigns. This disease **killed** millions of people in the past, but no cases **have been found** since 1980.

In recent years, vaccination **has played** a key role in stopping the spread of COVID-19. Governments **began** mass vaccination programs in 2020. Many people **have received** the vaccine, and studies **have shown** that it reduces serious illness and death.

Vaccination not only protects individuals but also communities. When enough people **have been vaccinated**, diseases **cannot spread** easily. This is called "herd immunity."

However, some people **have refused** vaccines for different reasons. They **believe** vaccines are unsafe, but science **has shown** that most vaccines **are** very safe and effective.

Vaccines **have changed** the way we live. Many diseases that once **caused** large outbreaks **have become** rare. Thanks to vaccination, we **have lived** longer and healthier lives.
